											 <p><strong>For you to join us, you will need to provide an entry ticket, which is ONE MANDATORY REFERAL. </strong><br/><br/>This mandatory referral must be a serious minded individual or organisation ready with their cash, and ready to be committed to the club and impact other people's lives through their donation. You must get the exact and correct information you and your mandatory referral intend to use in setting up your account. Upon registration, you will be requested to choose a package of your choice. The following donation 8 packages are currently available for you to choose from; <br/><br/>N10,000 - (STARTER) <br/>N20,000 - (MOBILE) <br/>N30,000 - (STANDARD) <br/>N50,000 - (BOOSTER) <br/>N100,000 - (INVESTORS) <br/>N200,000 - (ACHIEVERS) <br/>N300,000 - (TYCOONS) & <br/>N500,000 - (ENTREPREPNEURS).<br/><br/> When you have made your choice of donation package, the cash2cash club system will pair you with an existing club member for you to make your donation to.<br/><br/> 
You will have the opportunity to interact with this member through the information packet that will be provided on your Personal Office (PO) Dashboard. Kindly note that it is mandatory for you to communicate either by voice or sms with whoever you are making a donation to before executing the payment. You will have a maximum of 24hours to complete this payment, at the expiration of which the cash2cash club system will automatically delete your account. All donations are made directly to bonafide club members bank account. Any payment into an unregistered account is at your risk<br/><br/>
After you have successfully made your donation, you will be requested to upload a proof of payment (POP) which will range from; snapshot of the bank teller used in making the payment, your account debit alert showing recipient's name and amount paid etc. Upon confirmation by the recipient of your donation, via the clicking of the CONFIRMATION BUTTON on the donation recipient's dashboard, the system automatically transfers you to the queue of the DONATION/HELP RECIPIENTS LIST for your chosen donation package. And depending on the prevailing donation speed of the platform as of that moment, the cash2cash club payment system will pair you with 2 new or existing club members or a combination of both, to GET DONATIONS/HELP within a minimum of 2hours and a maximum of 7days. You must be aware that technically, you are tied to your referal until both of you complete the your first donation cycle.

For your CIRCLE OF DONATION/HELP to be completed, you would need to recieve donations from two club members who will be paired with you, to pay you a total of 200% of your donation/help amount. Upon reciept of these payments in your registered account and successful upload of the proof of payment (POP) by each person, you will be under obligation to confirm each of them by clicking the CONFIRMATION BUTTON against each of their names and account details. Failure to do this within 24hours of receiving payment will lead to your account being deleted. When you successfully confirm both of your Donors/Helpers, your account will automatically be transferred to the GIVE DONATION/PROVIDE HELP list of your chosen package for you to begin another cycle. You are advised to fill out a COMPLAINT TICKET at the top of your Personal Office (PO) Dashboard to report any issue regarding incomplete payment processes, abuse and other sundry matters.
